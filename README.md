**Specializing in AI-augmented development, library technology, and workflow automation.**  
With a background in IT librarianship and a passion for data, I build tools, data pipelines, and automated workflows that **turn information into actionable insight.**

I use AI as a **true development partner**, freeing me to focus on system architecture, data engineering, and delivering reliable, user-friendly solutions.

💡 **I believe technology is a gift from God — meant to serve people, bring light, and reflect His wisdom and creativity. Everything I build, I want to use for good and for God’s glory.**

My ultimate goal? **Contribute to a world-class team at Google while creating technology that honors God and helps people.**
