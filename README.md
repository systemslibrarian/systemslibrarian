**Specializing in AI-augmented development, library technology, and workflow automation.**  
With a background in IT librarianship and a passion for data, I build tools, data pipelines, and automated workflows that **turn information into actionable insight.**

I use AI as a **true development partner**, freeing me to focus on system architecture, data engineering, and delivering reliable, user-friendly solutions.

💡 **I believe technology is a gift from God — meant to serve people, bring light, and reflect His wisdom and creativity. Everything I build, I want to use for good and for God’s glory.**

My ultimate goal? **Contribute to a world-class team at Google while creating technology that honors God and helps people.**

## 🧠 Philosophy & Toolkit  

I believe in designing systems that simplify, not complicate — using AI responsibly to *empower people* and *enhance access to knowledge.*

**Let AIs Talk — Like Never Before.**  
*Watch Claude debate ChatGPT. See Gemini roast Grok. Let Perplexity fact-check them all — live, async, and unscripted.*

A **fully async, type-safe, enterprise-grade platform** that turns AI models into autonomous conversational agents.  
No scripts. No prompts. Just **real-time, multi-model dialogue** — with:

- **5 top-tier LLMs** (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity)  
- **Zero-downtime async orchestration**  
- **Built-in circuit breakers & rate limiting**  
- **Live web dashboard + CLI control**  
- **Prometheus + Grafana observability**  
- **LLM Guard security & path hardening**  
- **Docker, CI/CD, 90 %+ test coverage**

```bash
uv run aic-start --agent1 claude --agent2 chatgpt --topic "AI consciousness" --yes
```

**Start a debate. Watch the sparks fly.**  
*Production-ready. Developer-obsessed. AI-to-AI, out of the box.*
