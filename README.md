# Hi, I'm Paul ðŸ‘‹ â€” Application Systems Analyst

**Google Certified Data Analyst** specializing in **AI-augmented development**, **library technology**, and **workflow automation**.

With a background in IT librarianship and a passion for data, I bridge the gap between information systems and intelligent automation. I specialize in designing and building tools, data pipelines, and workflows that empower access to information and drive smarter decision-making. My development process leverages AI for efficiency, allowing me to focus on system architecture, data engineering, and ensuring every solution is rigorously tested and robust. I am actively honing this methodology with the specific goal of contributing to a world-class team at Google.

I actively share open-source tools, automation scripts, and data analysis projects here on GitHub.

## My Development Philosophy & Toolkit

My experience in library and information systems has shown me firsthand how critical efficient access to data is. I now build the tools to make that happen. I embrace an **AI-first approach**, serving as the architect and quality guarantor for every project. This allows me to translate complex requirements into working applications with exceptional speed and precision.
