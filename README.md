**Specializing in AI-augmented development, library technology, and workflow automation.**  
With a background in IT librarianship and a passion for data, I build tools, data pipelines, and automated workflows that **turn information into actionable insight.**

I use AI as a **true development partner**, freeing me to focus on system architecture, data engineering, and delivering reliable, user-friendly solutions.

💡 **I believe technology is a gift from God — meant to serve people, bring light, and reflect His wisdom and creativity. Everything I build, I want to use for good and for God’s glory.**

My ultimate goal? **Contribute to a world-class team at Google while creating technology that honors God and helps people.**

## 🧠 Philosophy & Toolkit  

I believe in designing systems that simplify, not complicate — using AI responsibly to *empower people* and *enhance access to knowledge.*

## 🌟 Featured Projects  

### 🤖 AI Conversation Platform — *Multi-Agent AI Collaboration*
🔗 https://github.com/systemslibrarian/AI-Conversation-Platform-The-Future-of-Multi-Agent-Collaboration

> **“Because AIs shouldn’t monologue — they should *converse*.”**

A **fully async, type-safe, enterprise-grade platform** that turns AI models into autonomous conversational agents.  
No scripts. No prompts. Just **real-time, multi-model dialogue**.

**Highlights**
- 5 top-tier LLMs (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity)
- Async orchestration with circuit breakers & rate limiting
- Web dashboard + CLI control
- Observability (Prometheus + Grafana)
- LLM Guard security & path hardening
- Docker, CI/CD, 90%+ test coverage

```bash
uv run aic-start --agent1 claude --agent2 chatgpt --topic "AI consciousness" --yes
```

*Production-ready. Developer-obsessed. AI-to-AI, out of the box.*

### 🔐 Meow-Decoder — *Secure Air-Gapped Data Transfer*
🔗 https://github.com/systemslibrarian/meow-decoder

**Meow-Decoder** explores how to securely move data across **air-gapped channels** (QR codes / animated images) using **modern, misuse-resistant cryptography**.

This project is intentionally built with a **security-review mindset**, emphasizing correctness, explicit protocols, and safe failure behavior.

**Security & Design Focus**
- AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption
- Argon2id password-based key derivation
- Strong tamper detection and non-leaky failure modes
- Explicit protocol specification (byte-level formats)
- Threat modeling and formal-methods scaffolding (TLA+ / symbolic analysis)
- Designed to resist misuse, not just pass tests

> **Status:** Pre-v1.0 — actively hardening toward a security-reviewed release  
> **Note:** Not yet audited; security claims are precise and intentionally conservative

*Built to explore cryptographic engineering discipline, not hype.*
